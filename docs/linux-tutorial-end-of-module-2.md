?> 링크: [https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-end-of-module-2/]()

Congratulations! You've finished the first and second modules of the Linux Survival course, and it wasn't even very painful, was it? You should now have a pretty good idea how to get around in a Linux environment. The commands you have learned in these modules are ones that you will probably use more often than any other commands.

If you need to refer back to this training module at some time in the future, you can quickly get to the appropriate course material by using the index on the left.

We recommend that you start using a real Linux system as soon as possible to ensure that you remember this material and put it to use. When you have more experience with Linux, please take Modules 3 and 4 of this course.

Thank you for choosing Linux Survival. If you found this course useful, please tell other people about it. Just send them to http://linuxsurvival.com.
