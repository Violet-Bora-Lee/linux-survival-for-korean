The "..." after the DESCRIPTION section means that we have left out something that you would normally see. We will use this notation quite often in the pages to come. The output shown here is only a fraction of what you would see on a real system, but it shows you all that you need to know to find Greg's UserID.

Recall that the original reason we wanted to find out Greg's UserID was so that we could search his home directory.
