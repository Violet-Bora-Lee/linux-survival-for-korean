We could get you to type two more "chmod" commands to modify the permissions of "gorillas" and "sq_monks", but there's an easier way using "wildcards".

In case you're wondering what the "tron>" prompt is all about, we're just using another imaginary machine called "tron", which could be a machine similar to "zoo".

A wildcard allows you to specify more than one file at the same time. The '*' matches any number of characters. For example, if you want to execute a command on all files in the current directory, you would specify '*' as the filename. If you want to be more selective and match only files which end in "ing", you would use "*ing". Note that the '*' can even match zero characters, so "*ing" would match "ing" as well as "sing".

The other wildcard, '?', is not used very often, but it can be useful. It matches exactly one character. For example, if you want to match "sport", but not "spat", you would use "sp??t". The first '?' matches the 'a' in "spat", but the second '?' can't match anything, so "spat" fails.

Type the command to give "write" permission to the prim "group" on "all files" in the current directory.

Then type the command to give a long listing of the files.
